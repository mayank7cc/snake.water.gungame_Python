Snake Water Gun Game – Python
This is a simple command-line Snake Water Gun game built using Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer, where the computer randomly selects Snake, Water, or Gun. The winner is decided using predefined rules and conditional logic.
The project demonstrates Python fundamentals such as user input handling, dictionaries, random number generation, and control flow. Two approaches to game logic are included: a simplified mathematical comparison and a traditional conditional method.
